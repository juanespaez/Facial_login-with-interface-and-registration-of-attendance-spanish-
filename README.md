# Facial_login-with-interface-and-registration-of-attendance-spanish-
In this project we will work on facial detection. We will be building an interface that will contain the required algorithms to check if someone has registered in the “database” with their face. However if they haven't it will allow them to register to later login by only introducing their username and face.
